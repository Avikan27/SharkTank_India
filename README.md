# üîç Discover Fascinating Insights on Shark Tank Indiaü¶àüöÄ

Welcome to the repository for my project on Shark Tank India! This project focuses on analyzing the captivating entrepreneurial reality show by creating an interactive report using MS Excel and Power BI.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to prepare a data visualization dashboard that showcases the Shark Tank India dataset sourced from Kaggle. By leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization, I aim to provide in-depth insights into the 320 pitches from both seasons of the show.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes comprehensive information on each pitch, encompassing the pitchers' demographics, company names, industry classifications, sharks' investments, ask prices, deal amounts, equity stakes, and more.

## Data Preparation 
Data preparation for this project involved applying the RITEC methodology, which includes reduction, integration, transformation, enrichment, and cleaning steps. I performed these steps using both Excel and Power BI to ensure the dataset's accuracy and integrity. The RITEC approach helped streamline and optimize the data for further analysis and visualization.

## Data Visualizations
Using the powerful visualization capabilities of Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the dataset with ease. The dashboard offers a range of visuals and filters, enabling users to analyze the pitches based on seasons, industry categories, and various other dimensions. Additionally, I utilized DAX functions to derive new measures for enhanced visualizations and deeper analysis.

## How to Use
To explore the interactive report, simply download or clone this repository and open the Power BI file provided. Once opened, you can interact with the visuals, apply filters, and uncover fascinating insights about Shark Tank India.
